The heart rate is within a reasonable range for a run of this distance and intensity.  A slight increase in training volume or intensity would be appropriate.\n"

            "Based on the run data, here are some tips:\n\n* **Maintain hydration:**  The runner noted good hydration, which is excellent.  Continue this practice, especially on longer runs.\n\n* **Listen to your body:** The runner felt leg heaviness.  Pay attention to these signals.  If fatigue increases significantly, consider adjusting training volume or intensity.\n\n* **Consider strength training:** Incorporating strength training, particularly for legs and core, can improve running performance and help prevent injuries.  This could help mitigate the leg heaviness.\n\n* **Gradual progression:**  Continue to ramp up training gradually.  Don't increase distance or intensity too quickly.\n\n* **Vary your runs:**  Introduce different types of runs (e.g., interval training, easy runs) to improve fitness and prevent overuse injuries.\n\n* **Nutrition:** Ensure adequate nutrition to support training efforts.  Consider adding more carbohydrates and protein to your diet.\n\n* **Rest and recovery:**  Prioritize adequate sleep and rest days to allow your body to recover.  Even a short nap or rest break might help reduce the end of run fatigue.\n"
